# Debugging Data

Your software consistently provides impressive music recommendations
by combining cultural and audio data. Customers are happy.
However, things aren't always perfect. Sometimes that Beyoncé track is
attributed to Beyonce. The artist for the Béla Fleck solo album shows up as
Béla Fleck and the Flecktones. Worse, the 宇多田ヒカル biography
has the artist name listed as ??????. Where did things go wrong?
Did one of your customers provide you with data in an incorrect
character encoding? Did one of the web-crawlers have a bug? Perhaps
the name resolution code was incorrectly combining a solo artist
with his band?

One of the most important tricks for dealing with
multi-provenance data is traceability and debuggability.
